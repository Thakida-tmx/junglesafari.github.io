								<p>"Embracing diversity and promoting inclusivity is crucial in the fight against racism. By saying no to racism, we can create a society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. It's time to break down barriers, challenge biases, and stand together against discrimination. Let's unite to build a world where equality, justice, and love prevail, and where everyone has the opportunity to thrive."----This is what albert has to say about Racism..Spread love.</p>
